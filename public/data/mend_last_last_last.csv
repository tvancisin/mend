Bourita urged Libyan institutions and protagonists to seize the existing opportunity to find a solution and insisted that that the settlement of the crisis in Libya is between the hands of the Libyans.

In all its initiatives, Morocco always keeps in mind that “the success of the political process depends largely on its progress under the aegis of the United Nations, to guarantee respect for international legality,” he said.

Would be great for 30 June to be a day of celebration, rather than new protests.""...Protesters and opposition groups that are demanding the military hand over power to civilian rule said Thursday it received a new proposal for a transition drafted by Ethiopia and the African Union.The new proposal calls for a civilian-majority ruling council as demanded by protesters, but it fails to mention the make-up of a new transitional parliament.“The Alliance for Freedom and Change received the draft… and will be considering the proposal to make a decision,” the umbrella group said in a statement.The move comes after Sudan’s ruling generals urged mediators from the AU and Ethiopia to unify their efforts and come up with a joint proposal on the country’s transition.It entails creating a 15-member, civilian-majority governing body for a three-year transitional period.But it makes no mention of the composition of a legislative body.An earlier proposal drafted by Ethiopia had stipulated a transitional parliament of 300 lawmakers, with 67 percent of them from the Alliance for Freedom and Change.The remaining 33 percent were to be from other political groups, excluding now ousted longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir defunct National Congress Party....Kabbashi had earlier said the Transitional Military Council, TMC, had not even looked at the Ethiopian plan because it was from only one stakeholder.Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was in Khartoum earlier this month after special forces forcibly broke up a sit-in killing hundreds and injuring many more.The junta and protest leaders had cut all contact despite Abiy’s envoy managing to secure an agreement for resumption. The protesters have since called for a mediator saying they had lost trust in the TMC.An earlier proposal by Abiy Ahmed had been accepted by the protesters but rejected by the military. The new joint proposal from the AU and Ethiopia now aims to provide a basis for renewed negotiations, with the goal of establishing a civilian-led transitional administration in Sudan.",https://www.france24.com/en/20190629-sudan-generals-say-au-ethiopian-plan-basis-talks-with-protesters;http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/sudan-generals-say-au-ethiopian-plan-basis-for-talks-with-protesters/article/553015;https://www.africanews.com/2019/06/29/sudan-s-army-accepts-au-ethiopia-transition-proposal-as-protestors-plan/;https://allafrica.com/stories/201906300044.html;https://www.africanews.com/2019/05/20/sudan-s-president-bashir-steps-down-govt-sources/,0,M

Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, deputy chief of the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC), and Ibrahim al-Amin from the protest movement, both marked the occasion as a ""historic moment"" for Sudan.The agreement, brokered by the African Union and Ethiopian mediators, establishes a new transitional civilian-military ruling body designed to navigate Sudan through its political crisis.

The six civilian members will include five from the Alliance for Freedom and Change.Ethiopian mediator Mahmud Dirir emphasized the need for Sudan to overcome poverty and called for the removal of Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. The formal signing ceremony, which was attended by international observers including representatives from the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and the Arab League, marks a crucial step toward a political transition.While the Political Declaration is a landmark achievement, both sides will continue negotiations on the ""Constitutional Declaration,"" expected to be signed soon.

He says if we consider the TMC's admission to be a step towards accountability, we demand transparent trials and the punishment of the killers.Despite the killings and tension, the TMC and the opposition resumed talks late Thursday under the guidance of African mediators.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/03/sudanese-military-and-protesters-reach-full-agreement-on-power-sharing-deal;https://news.sky.com/story/sudan-agrees-new-period-of-transitional-government-11776246;https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/africa/2019-08-03-sudanese-factions-agree-plan-to-pave-way-for-transitional-government/;https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/03/sudan-s-military-and-opposition-coalition-agree-on-constitutional-declaration;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-08/04/c_138283351.htm;https://www.voanews.com/africa/talks-sudans-govt-continue-despite-latest-protester-deaths;https://theglobepost.com/2019/08/01/sudan-talks-protest/,0,M

Also, a popular celebration and parties will be held in the Freedom Park which is nearby the Hall.The residents of Atbara where were killed the first protesters in December 2018 will participate in the celebrations, as a train full of people arrived in Khartoum on Friday.

The deal, which finalizes the constitutional declaration initially inked on August 4, aims to pave the way for a transitional government and eventual elections.The agreement was reached after nearly eight months of intense upheaval and protests against Bashir, who was ousted in April after 30 years in power. The deal was brokered with strong mediation from the African Union and Ethiopia. The signing ceremony, held in Khartoum, was attended by international representatives, including the presidents of Chad, Kenya, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan, as well as the prime ministers of Egypt and Ethiopia, and other prominent figures such as Saudi Arabia's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs.The deal has been welcomed by both the military council and the opposition coalition, the Alliance for Freedom and Change. The agreement was seen as a crucial step in restoring stability to Sudan, which has been grappling with an economic crisis and a volatile regional context. The compromise, while addressing several key demands of the protest camp, allows the military to retain significant powers, posing ongoing challenges for the future civilian government.In a notable development, Sudan’s Sovereign Council was sworn in on August 21, with Abdalla Hamdok appointed as Prime Minister. This event marked a significant milestone in Sudan’s transition to democracy. The swearing-in was celebrated by many Sudanese in Khartoum, reflecting their hopes for the future.The signing of the agreement received broad international support, with the European Union and other global partners witnessing the ceremony. The UN Security Council, the EU, and the Troika (the US, UK, and Norway) all expressed support for the agreement. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also extended congratulations and support to the transitional authorities.The formation of the Sovereign Council and the appointment of the Prime Minister are seen as critical steps in Sudan’s journey toward peace, democracy, and prosperity. The road ahead remains challenging, but the international and regional backing provides a foundation for hopeful progress in Sudan’s transition.""While four regional leaders of South Sudan, Chad, Kenya and the Ethiopian Prime Minister will attend the ceremony, the Egyptian President who is the head of the African Union declined the invitation as will be represented by his Prime Minister Mostafa Kemal Madbouly.Expected to arrive in Khartoum, Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Hamad Al Sabah-First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kuwait, Adel Al-Jubeir Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa Bahrain’s Foreign Minister and Yousef Al-Othaimeen the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.

The United States, taking the role of “external mediator,” hosted a late January meeting in Washington that helped hammer out the “joint responsibility” for managing drought crises agreement.

A ministerial meeting involving the water and foreign ministers from Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan was scheduled for February 27-28 in Washington to finalize the rules for filling and operating the GERD. However, Ethiopia announced a day before the meeting that it would not participate in the talks, citing unfinished consultations with national stakeholders. Following the U.S.-brokered talks, Ethiopia rejected the draft agreement, stating that the text reportedly initialed by Egypt did not reflect the outcomes of negotiations with Sudan and Egypt.

Pompeo had previously emphasized the importance of Sudan's removal from the list and expressed support for the civilian-led transitional government in Khartoum during his August visit.In addition to negotiating Sudan's delisting, the delegation is also expected to discuss financial support for Sudan's transitional government, including the possibility of writing off American debts and urging other nations to support Sudan's debt relief process.

This comprehensive deal aimed to end long-standing conflicts between the Sudanese government and various armed groups, including factions from Darfur, South Kordofan, Blue Nile, and other regions.The signing ceremony, attended by a wide array of local, regional, and international dignitaries, included Sudan's Sovereign Council Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and South Sudanese President Salva Kiir. Notable attendees also included representatives from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Chad, Egypt, the African Union, the United Nations, and the European Union.Qatar played a pivotal role as one of the key sponsors of the negotiations, with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad Al Muraikhi describing the event as a “unique moment in history” that represents the hopes of millions displaced by war. The agreement covers various aspects, including security arrangements, power and wealth sharing, compensation for displaced individuals, land ownership, and justice and development.The signing was widely celebrated as a crucial step towards achieving lasting peace in Sudan. The African Union's Chairperson, Moussa Faki, affirmed the AU's commitment to supporting the implementation of the deal, acknowledging the challenges ahead. Similarly, Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly expressed Egypt's support for the agreement and commitment to enhancing bilateral relations with Sudan.The peace deal follows a year of intensive negotiations mediated by South Sudan, which has been instrumental in facilitating dialogue between the Sudanese government and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF). The UN Security Council also welcomed the agreement, viewing it as a significant opportunity for Sudan to move towards a stable and democratic future...."" This agreement comprises a series of in-essence 6 different agreements which provide for agreement between the Transitional Government of Sudan (TGOS)and different areas, on different but interconnected peace process 'tracks'. These comprise a Darfur Agreement between the TGOS and 'Darfur Parties to Peace' (Title 2); a 'Two Areas' agreements between TGOS and the The Sudan People's Liberation Movement - North / The Revolutionary Front (Title 3); the Eastern Sudan Track Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 4); Track 5, Agreement between the TGOS and the Sudan Revolutionary Front - Northern Track (Title 5); Agreement of the Central Track between the TSGO and the Sudan Revolutionary Front (Title 6); and Security arrangements between the TSGO and the Third-Front - Tamazuj (Title 7). While the agreements are all varied, they provide on the most part for some representation of these areas in the transitional government and/or wider institutional structures of the transition, and for new governance and security and economic / development provision within each area. The Agreement therefore in its totality in a sense connects the wider armed conflict with different groups, or different factions or branches of the same broad group, with the transition process focused on the move from military rule at the level of the central state, and with the Transitional government (itself a mixed military-civilian government).

Sudan has suspended its engagement and frozen all dealings with the IGAD regarding the resolution of the ongoing conflict in the country, citing the organization's interference in its internal affairs. In a statement released on Tuesday, the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Djiboutian foreign minister, in his capacity as the current IGAD chair, of the government's decision to disengage from IGAD's involvement in resolving Sudan's crisis. The disengagement was decided in response to Sudan's inclusion on the agenda of the extraordinary meeting without prior consultation with the Sudanese government, and the IGAD's invitation to a militia leader to attend the Kampala summit. Sudanese officials are upset that a rebel leader was invited to a meeting for heads of state and government. On January 13, the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the head of the Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan would not attend the 42nd summit due to the failure of the IGAD to secure a meeting between him and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)....The Intergovernmental Authority on Development's (IGAD) efforts to end the conflict between Sudan military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his paramilitary rival General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo is hanging in the balance.

According to reports by international media outlets, Sudan leader General al-Burhan, on Tuesday, accused IGAD of inviting General Dagalo to the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement Summit to be conducted by its members - Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and Sudan. Al-Burhan's administration claimed that his nemesis was invited without its knowledge which it claimed risked the peace and well-being of the warring nation. Sudan's Foreign Ministry which raised the concern, however, did not indicate whether it was willing to hold talks with IGAD which was accused of bias. The meeting came against the backdrop of IGAD ending Ruto's mission to mediate between the waring parties in Sudan owing to al-Burhan's protests. al-Burhan had also accused Ruto of siding with his paramilitary rival General Dagalo....""The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-country trade bloc in East Africa, kicked off its Assembly of Heads of State and Government on Thursday in Uganda.Leaders of the organization, made up of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda, called for the 42nd Extraordinary Session to contain a wave of tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia and breathe new life into face-to-face meetings between the heads of Sudan's warring factions, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).Both Sudan and Ethiopia declined to attend.""...

She said Britain, which leads the negotiating and drafting of resolutions on Sudan, would soon circulate a draft resolution to Security Council members. ""The draft resolution will be based on the secretary-general's recommendations and will focus on developing a compliance mechanism for the warring parties' commitments they made on the protection of civilians in Jeddah over a year ago, in 2023, and ways to support mediation efforts to deliver a cease-fire, even if we start with local cease-fires before moving to a national one,"" she said. ..... The United Nations Security Council is discussing a British-drafted resolution that demands Sudan's warring parties cease hostilities and calls on them to allow safe, rapid and unhindered deliveries of aid across front lines and borders.... The people of Sudan face an ever-deepening crisis as the relentless war between rival militaries pushes the country further into chaos, the UN’s top political affairs official told the Security Council on Tuesday, underscoring that a ceasefire and a negotiated political solution remain the only viable path to peace. “Sudan is trapped in a nightmare,” Rosemary DiCarlo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs told ambassadors, echoing the grim declaration made by the Secretary-General two weeks ago. Calling for an immediate ceasefire, Ms. DiCarlo underscored that an end to fighting is the most effective way of protecting civilians. “It is long past time for the warring parties to come to the negotiating table. The only path out of this conflict is a negotiated political solution.” While rival militaries might not be ready for a negotiated settlement, Sudan’s partners have a responsibility to press them to work for one, she said, commending the African Union (AU), the regional development body, IGAD, and the international group supporting humanitarian efforts and peace talks, ALPS – for their attempts to bring the rival generals to the negotiating table. The UN will continue to engage with warring parties through Ramtane Lamamra, the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Sudan, including through regional visits and proximity talks, she added. Ramesh Rajasingham, Director for Coordination at OCHA, told ambassadors that humanitarian organizations “remain unable to reach the vast majority of people in conflict hotspots across Sudan at anything approaching adequate scale.” .... Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Monday calling for an immediate end to hostilities in Sudan where a war between two rival generals has been raging since April 2023.

On 12 November, the Council held a high-level briefing on the situation in Sudan. Briefing at the meeting, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA) Rosemary DiCarlo strongly condemned the RSF’s attacks on civilians and the SAF’s indiscriminate airstrikes in populated areas. She stressed that both parties bear responsibility for the ongoing violence, highlighting that a cessation of hostilities is the most effective way to protect civilians. DiCarlo pointed to the continued escalation of military operations, the recruitment of new fighters, and intensified attacks by both sides, enabled by “considerable external support,” including a steady influx of weapons into the country. She criticised the role of external actors in fuelling the conflict, describing their involvement as “unconscionable” and “illegal”.DiCarlo said that the Personal Envoy of Secretary-General Ramtane Lamamra is considering the next phase of his engagement with the warring parties, including another round of “proximity talks” focused on commitments related to the protection of civilians. She urged immediate action to implement the Jeddah Declaration, signed by both parties on 11 May 2023 and highlighted the importance of a compliance mechanism to hold the parties accountable to their commitments. She underlined the need to make progress on achieving local ceasefires that could create avenues for dialogue and potentially lay the ground for a more comprehensive agreement......

Sudan is expected to participate under rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure. Tomorrow, the briefers and several Council members are expected to condemn the ongoing violence across Sudan and reiterate the call for an immediate cessation of hostilities. They might highlight the imperative to ensure accountability and justice for victims of violence and call on the parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law.

The letter stressed that the UN, its representatives, and staff should not communicate with “terrorist organizations” along with “groups and their affiliated illegal administrative entities in northwestern Syria”.

The note stated that the “Syrian Government’s permission can be a basis for the [UN] to lawfully conduct cross-border humanitarian operations via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing for the specified duration”. However, it also said that the Syrian government’s letter contained two unacceptable conditions: that the UN should not communicate with entities designated as “terrorist”, and that the ICRC and the SARC should supervise and facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid in northwest Syria.

She highlighted that funding shortages for relief efforts had significantly curtailed the ability of humanitarian organisations to provide assistance in the country. In some cases, she pointed out, these shortages had led to the scaling back of health services in several areas: in north-west Syria, for instance, over 30 outpatient therapeutic feeding programmes for malnourished children have been forced to close since October 2023 and over 75 nutrition rapid response teams–about half the total–have suspended operations. Syria’s 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which required $5.41 billion, had received 37.8% percent funding ($2.04 billion), $31 million less than the 2022 HRP, which required $4.44 billion....In his remarks at the 21 March Council meeting, Pedersen described the intensified hostilities in the country and stressed the urgent need for de-escalation and restoration of calm leading to a nationwide ceasefire.

The donor community pledged €7.5 billion, including €5 billion in grants and €2.5 billion of loan for 2024 and future years.... Since 2011, the EU and its Member States have been the largest assistance donors to Syria and the region.

Griffiths provided an overview of the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in the country and the devastating consequences of the persisting insecurity on civilians. He apprised members of a recent uptick in hostilities in Deir-ez-Zor governorate in eastern Syria, particularly near the UN humanitarian hub, which damaged humanitarian assets and led to the temporary suspension of humanitarian operations. He also spoke about the situation of women and girls in the country, noting that they continue to be exposed to appalling levels of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, exploitation, and abuse. Griffiths called on relevant parties to allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief while taking note of the lack of progress in cross-line delivery of aid—that is, across domestic conflict lines from Syrian government-held areas into areas outside government control. Lack of necessary approvals and security guarantees, among other things, continue to impede the cross-line delivery of humanitarian assistance....In his remarks at the 30 May meeting, Pedersen said that there was no clear path emerging to implementing resolution 2254 of 18 December 2015, which focused on finding a political solution to the Syrian crisis, including through the reconvening of the Syrian Constitutional Committee. Efforts to resume the Constitutional Committee remain stalled. He underlined the importance of preparing for a new and more comprehensive approach, noting that there must be a political horizon to resolve complex conflicts instead of managing or containing them in perpetuity. Highlighting the lack of trust among the stakeholders, he said that only concrete engagement, coordination and action could bring reciprocal and verifiable progress. The absence of a way forward threatens to cause prolonged division and despair. (For background and more information, see our Syria brief in the June Monthly Forecast and 24 June What’s in Blue story.) ...Pedersen also described the ongoing hostilities and persisting security tensions within Syria, including insurgent activities by some tribal elements against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a primarily Kurdish group opposing the Syrian government; the violent crackdown on protestors in Idlib by the Security Council-listed terrorist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham; and ongoing protests in al-Sweida governorate, which started in August 2023 against the backdrop of the deteriorating economic situation in the country. He stressed the need for urgent de-escalation across all the frontlines within Syria and in the region, starting with a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.

(A cross-line mission goes across domestic conflict lines from Syrian government-held areas into areas outside government control.)

Two civil society representatives also participated at the meeting—Regional Vice President (Middle East and North Africa) at the International Rescue Committee Su’ad Jarbawi and Abir Haj Ibrahim, a peacebuilder from Syria. Pedersen highlighted the urgent need to prevent Syria from becoming “a free-for-all venue, where different actors settle their scores or fuel other theatres, nor a staging ground for attacks or retaliation”. He called for de-escalating regional tensions and for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon. He also expressed concern about the prospect of further escalations between Israel and Iran and what this could mean for Syria. Moreover, he cautioned that regional escalation posed a risk of undermining ceasefire agreements that, despite their imperfections, have maintained a crucial freeze in the front lines within Syria for nearly four years.On the political front, Pedersen noted that partial, piecemeal or conflict-management approaches alone could not tackle the scale of the ever-mounting challenges facing Syria. He remarked that Syria would continue to be embroiled in crises unless the long-stalled Syrian-owned and -led political process facilitated by the UN resumes and begins to move forward. He underlined the need to develop a “new and comprehensive” path out of the conflict, one that addresses the political issues central to the conflict as well as issues pertaining to sovereignty, security, civilian protection, and economic issues.In her remarks, Wosornu stressed the need to ensure the safety and security of Syrians who are fleeing Lebanon under extreme duress and the freedom to reach their preferred destinations. She also called for unhindered access for the humanitarian organisations providing aid to those arriving and all people in need. She said that the humanitarian response is now shifting to providing assistance to people in the areas where they have settled and to support host families and communities, “many of whom are themselves already stretched to breaking point”. She said that attacks at the Lebanon-Syria border crossings have rendered the roads impassable for vehicles, forcing people to cross the border on foot. In addition, she pointed to the disruptions caused in the transport of humanitarian assistance and commercial goods because of damage to the roads connecting Lebanon and Syria.Wosornu also highlighted the UN inter-agency emergency appeal for $324 million for the influx from Lebanon to Syria to support up to 480,000 people over the next six months. This appeal is in addition to Syria’s 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which requires $4.07 billion. At the time of writing, the HRP was only 27.2 percent funded.

But as I speak to you this afternoon, these are being severely tested, with HTS and armed opposition groups gaining ground today, advancing very close to Hama – a major city of some 1 million people,"" said Pedersen.He was referring to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a UN-designated terrorist group that grew out of al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate but broke with it in 2017.Pedersen said ""pro-government"" airstrikes have intensified in recent days, hitting civilian and military targets and resulting in Syrian casualties.

But – and this is my second core message – de-escalation needs to be accompanied by a credible political horizon for the Syrian people,"" he added.Clashes broke out on Nov. 27 between Assad regime forces and anti-regime armed groups in the western countryside of Aleppo in northern Syria, marking a re-escalation of the fighting after a period of relative calm in the conflict that has gripped Syria for nearly 14 years.Russia, a key backer of the Syrian regime, lashed out at the anti-regime offensive, saying it has resulted in the deaths of at least 30 civilians.""We categorically condemn this coordinated attack by HTS terrorists who control Idlib, destabilizing the already fraught situation on Syrian soil,"" Vasily Nebenzya, Moscow’s UN envoy, told the council.""The enemy will be defeated, regardless of what external support is being provided to them, and there is such external support.

Indian officials worry that the U.S., desperate to strike a peace deal before its troops depart, will allow Pakistan to play a driving role in the talks. Pakistan has long relied on the Taliban to serve as its proxy for maintaining influence in the country. If the Taliban regains influence in Afghanistan without agreeing to participate in a normal political process or relinquishing violence, Afghanistan will again become a haven for international terrorists, and support for Islamist extremist ideologies will flourish throughout the region. Since then, the Vienna Process has gained further momentum, “having brought together 40 different parties, including Afghan organizations such as women’s movements, civil society, media representatives, and influential individuals.” We experienced the diversity of Afghan voices firsthand when we took part in the fourth meeting of the Vienna Process in June 2024. It was the first time that the meeting felt ""Afghan–led,"" ""Afghan–owned,"" and ""Afghan–managed,"" with foreign dignitaries and guests only attending the closing session of the two–day meeting to listen to Afghans discuss the way forward, with the support of the international community.The Vienna Process seeks to rationalize the status quo under the Taliban. Unlike the Doha Process, the Vienna Process is an inclusive platform that invites all Afghan sides, including the Taliban, to join the effort to free Afghanistan from fear, terror, drugs, and want. Coming together under the Vienna Process to build on the progress made so far is an opportunity no serious Afghan side should miss. This will further develop the process into an overarching umbrella for meaningful intra–Afghan dialogue, which, with international support and regional cooperation, should lead to a sustainable political settlement and the formation of an inclusive government with national legitimacy and international recognition.",https://www.heritage.org/asia/report/kerry-india-setting-the-tone-security-issues,0,MR

Taliban officials participated, which they had not in the first two Doha meetings, in May 2023 and in February. Over 25 countries and international organisations took part in the meeting. The discussion focused on two tracks: economic matters (including developing the private sector) and counter-narcotics. As an outgrowth of the meeting, working groups are expected to be established on private sector economic matters and counter-narcotics that will develop lines of communication between the Taliban and donor countries and states in the region. Civil society representatives (including women) were excluded from the discussion.Briefing the press following the meeting, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, who represented the UN, indicated that although the de facto authorities (that is, the Taliban) would not “sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format…they heard very clearly the need to include women and civil society in all aspects of public life”.…“A delegation of the Islamic Emirate will participate in the coming Doha conference.

""Russia fully supports the right and desire of the Afghan people to live in peace and stability. And the stability in the region depends on this. However, it is impossible to build a lasting and sustainable peace without interaction with the de-facto authorities on a wide range of problems, and there is no alternative to this path. The way out of the current dead end and Afghanistan’s subsequent international reintegration depend on this.""Meanwhile, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan and Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan Roza Otunbayeva said that the United Nations welcomes Taliban’s willingness to take part in an UN conference on Afghanistan in Doha and thinks that this is essential for beginning the process of building trust between the Taliban and the world community.…According to the Afghan official, the agenda of the meeting includes efforts to counter narcotics and discuss alternatives for the poppy growers; financial and banking issues; and, climate change.Like Pakistan, freak weather events have badly affected Afghanistan in recent years, with floods and earthquakes wreaking havoc across large swathes of the country.While observers believe that the Doha talks may well pave the way for further progress on several key issues, there is a recognition that a lot of important matters are being left out of the discussion just to maintain a cordial atmosphere.…The third Doha meeting, unlike the first and second meetings, which were held under the supervision of António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, will be conducted under the oversight of Rosemary DiCarlo, Guterres’s deputy...Previously, an official from the Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the agenda of the Doha meeting has been shared with the group, and the discussions will focus on issues related to the private sector, finance, banking, and combating drug trafficking.…Officials from the UN confirmed that their talks with the Taliban next week in Doha on the future of war-torn Afghanistan will be held without the presence of Afghan women at the table.This will be the first meeting between the Taliban and 22 other international envoys since the takeover of Kabul by the group in 2021 after the US and Nato forces left the country.Roza Otunbayeva, the UN special envoy for Afghanistan, defended the decision to keep women and civil society members out of the crucial talks....The upcoming dialogue is being held to discuss the war-torn nation’s future, economic crisis, drug addiction impacting millions and stability in the region, and excludes talks on women’s and humanitarian rights violations by the Taliban.…The UN-sponsored talks on Afghanistan to be held in Doha, Qatar on June 30 and July 1 will be crucial because the Afghan Taliban government has been formally invited in the parleys, unlike in the earlier two rounds, to become part of dialogue to explore strategies for peace and stability in that war-torn country.…U.N. Special Envoy Roza Otunbayeva, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, is holding a meeting with the Taliban and envoys from 22 countries to ask the Taliban to protect women’s rights. Absent from this meeting are Afghan women, the ones who are being oppressed by the fundamentalist Islamic regime that blocks them from working, leaving the home, or going to school.Otunbayeva insists “nobody dictated” that women must be left out of the meeting, meaning that the U.N. chose to make that part of the procedure in keeping with its tradition of pandering to the worst governments in the world. The U.N. had already been working toward recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan once the Taliban took over the country again, and Otunbayeva is going to legitimize them further in a useless meeting in which U.N. officials will ask very nicely for the Taliban to respect women, and the Taliban will laugh and go on with their normal activities.…The upcoming UN-led Doha meeting on Afghanistan will be chaired by the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peace building Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo on behalf of the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.…The United Nations proves yet again that it is without a shred of credibility, especially when it comes to the rights of women.Capitulating to terrorists isn't a good look. The United Nations is holding a conference on Afghanistan in Doha beginning on June 30. It is scheduled to discuss the international community's approach to Afghanistan. Women's rights are not on the agenda. Also, the Taliban is demanding that Afghan women be shut out from participating in the conference.…Both US special representatives for Afghanistan Thomas West and Rina Amiri will attend the third UN-convened meeting in Doha on Afghanistan, the State Department . . .…The UN-led meeting aims to engage with the Islamic Emirate on various issues including engagement going forward, along with sessions on private sector business and counter-narcotics.This UN official also says that the work on appointing a UN special representative for Afghanistan is currently pending and will not be discussed in the Doha meeting....We participate in this meeting to pressure the Taliban (Islamic Emirate) together with the international community to fulfill their obligations to the Doha Agreement, including their behavior towards women,” said Miller.Previously, Rina Amiri, the US special representative for women, girls and human rights in Afghanistan, said that until the issue of human rights is included in the agenda of the future talks in Afghanistan, conflicts will continue in this country.…Fast-forward seven years, and the diplomatic circus surrounding the United Nations-led Doha meetings of special representatives for Afghanistan, set for a third round from June 30 to July 1...News reports suggest that the “Doha 3” official agenda will cover a wide range of items intended as inducements to get the Taliban on board with issues that too many in the international community apparently consider a higher priority than human rights and the subjugation of women. These apparent priority issues include discussions on counter-narcotics measures and related incentives to offer alternative livelihoods to opium poppy growers, as well as issues related to climate change and the environment, banking and financial flows, and the role of the private sector in all of the above (in a weak effort by the organizers to demonstrate that they are engaging with players other than the Taliban)....There is, rhetorically at least, also an agreement among Security Council members on what a sustainable outcome should look like. As described in the independent assessment and reinforced by Security Council Resolution 2721 that followed in December, the end goal is “an Afghanistan at peace with itself and its neighbors, fully reintegrated into the international community and meeting international obligations.” The resolution also says the Council “recognizes the need to ensure the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of Afghan women in the process throughout.”Under “any other business” at the end of the meeting, some participants have indicated they might, if time permits, raise other issues such as the Taliban’s assault on human rights, girls’ education and permission for women to work, and questions related to migration, a potential national dialogue that some advocates have called for, and the possible appointment of a U.N. special representative, which the Taliban has resisted.…The UN’s Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for Afghanistan has stated that if women are excluded from the Doha talks due to the Taliban’s presence, the cost of such exclusion would be very significant.….Benett stated, “Following talks with the Taliban, the agenda of the session will focus on drug trafficking and aiding the private sector.” He added that human rights or women’s issues will not be discussed, and women or civil society representatives will not participate.…The meeting was opened at 8:45pm with opening remarks by UN Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, followed by welcoming remarks from Qatari officials. The talks will conclude tomorrow.Pakistan is also attending the talks, with the delegation being led by Asif Khan Durrani, the country’s special representative on Afghanistan.Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani, Islamabad’s envoy in Kabul, is also part of the delegation.There are two items on the official agenda, which has been seen by Dawn.com: enabling the private sector, and countering narcotics and sustaining progress.…Two days of UN-organized talks on international relations with Taliban-led Afghanistan were getting under way in the Qatari capital, Doha, on June 30, with the Taliban present for the first time -- but rights groups expressed anger over the hard-line fundamentalist regime’s exclusion of women and its refusal to discuss women's rights at the forum.…It has been reported that Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and the host of this meeting, will speak at the beginning of the meeting.Following her, Qatar’s representative as the host country will address the gathering, and then Zabihullah Mujahid, the head of the Taliban’s negotiating team, will deliver a speech. The agenda allows each special representative to speak on their topic for up to three minutes thereafter.Zakir Jalali, the Head of the Third Political Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Taliban, said in a tweet that on the second day of the Doha meeting, discussions will focus on financial and banking sanctions, the private sector, combating narcotics, and maintaining progress. …ISTANBULThe Taliban-led Afghan interim administration Sunday called for “delineating” Afghanistan’s internal matters from foreign relations to achieve “advancements” in bilateral and multilateral engagements. Besides, it put forward three key requirements before the international community to help the war-torn nation make progress as it battles poverty, broken economy, and weak healthcare.These needs were key parts of a statement delivered by the Afghan interim administration’s chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid as the two-day UN-hosted meeting on Afghanistan opened in Qatari capital Doha.The key areas include removing all restrictions and sanctions on Afghanistan’s banking sector, unfreezing central bank reserves of around $7 billion and providing alternative livelihood to the nation’s farmers as drug crop and processing has entirely been banned.…About the UN-sponsored talks with Afghanistan that began in Doha on Monday, he said it was ""useful"" but was sceptical of its outcome.""Everybody wishes well to Afghanistan, but the roadmap how to do it is different from country to country and the devil is in the details,"" he said.The West prioritised human rights and ""genuine rights"" of women and girls in dealing with the Taliban regime, he added.""We also are saying that, of course, the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan should be observed and that the government of Afghanistan should be inclusive, inclusive, not just by nationalities but by... the political spectrum that exists to represent the country fully,"" he said.But the ""Taliban is de-facto authorities within Afghanistan and we've been saying consistently that you have to recognise this fact,"" Nebenzia added.…The UN says the talks are part of an ongoing process aimed at a future where Afghanistan is at peace internally and with its neighbours, fully integrated into the international community and where it meets international obligations, including on human rights, particularly the rights of women and girls.…Doha, Qatar: Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo has said that the third meeting of special envoys concerned with Afghanistan, being held in Doha, is largely fruitful and ongoing….She noted that the concerns and opinions of Afghan women and the civil society was important for the United Nations.“The meaningful inclusion of women in political and peace processes is a guiding principle. These issues have been raised in all sessions with the de facto authorities.”…The United Nations’ recent talks with the Taliban have brought to the forefront the complex and often contentious issue of women’s rights in Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid’s assertion that women’s rights are an internal matter underscores the significant ideological chasm between the Taliban and the international community. The UN’s characterization of the Taliban’s stance as “gender apartheid” reflects a deep concern for the human rights abuses occurring under Taliban rule. This article critically analyzes the implications of these talks, their potential to resolve the issue, and their impact on global human rights and women’s rights.…The United Nations (UN) is facing criticism for holding talks with Taliban officials in Doha that expressly excluded Afghan civil society, ensuring that no Afghan women were present. Envoys from approximately twenty-five countries and regional organizations attended the meetings while insisting that the process was not a step toward formal recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate leaders of Afghanistan. The meetings focused on topics including narcotics and the private sector. At the Taliban’s insistence, human rights—including women’s rights—were off the table as they allege that these are issues that must be handled internally by Taliban officials in accordance with Islamic law. The UN did hold separate meetings for Afghan civil society representatives, but they were boycotted by many activists. “There was broad agreement on the need to chart a clear way forward,” said Rosemary DiCarlo, undersecretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs at the UN, adding, “Regrettably, the de facto authorities will not sit across the table with Afghan civil society in this format.” …AHEAD of the recently concluded ‘Doha III’ talks on Afghanistan, the United Nations was in a bind.Bringing the Afghan Taliban to the negotiating table was their primary goal, but it would require a deft touch and many balancing acts.Issues such as human rights, women’s treatment and education, as well as the resurgence of terror groups weighed heavily on the conscience of diplomats participating in these meetings of Special Envoys on Afghanistan.....It was a candid discussion with the Taliban, the first time they have met the international community collectively since the fall of Kabul,” a Doha-based Western diplomat told Dawn.He claimed that human rights, especially for women and girls, were discussed extensively.…Last week, in response to a UN initiative, Taliban representatives met in Doha, Qatar, with diplomats from 25 countries and international organizations to discuss the future of Afghanistan. Before the meeting even began, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid made clear that the issue of women's rights was an ""internal matter"" for Afghanistan and would not be on the agenda in Doha. Other countries, he insisted, needed to acknowledge Afghanistan's religious and cultural values.…Representatives of over two dozen countries and international organizations came to Doha at the end of June to meet with senior Taliban leaders as part of a UN-facilitated discussion. This interaction, commonly known as “Doha 3,” was the third part of an ongoing process initiated over a year ago in an effort to create a cohesive platform to deal with ground realities in Afghanistan. While the Taliban agreed for the first time to directly participate, their involvement did not yield any decisive outcomes, even though only non-contentious issues, such as facilitating business and boosting counter-narcotics measures, were on the agenda. Despite relegating discussions with Afghan women and civil society representatives to the sidelines of the main dialogue in order to ensure the Taliban’s participation, Western officials seemed reserved about conceding to Taliban requests to enable regional trade given concerns that it might primarily serve Chinese and Russian interests. Other critics of these Doha dialogues feel that they are not doing enough to try to hold the Taliban accountable for domestic human rights violations.…There are separate talks taking place hosted by the UN and Qatar. But here, too, the hosts agreed to the Taliban’s demands that no women’s organizations be represented and that the agenda for these talks would exclude education. The Taliban are seeking international recognition, including membership of the UN. Afghanistan desperately needs trade deals to revive an economy that is on its knees. Yet, it is unacceptable that the international community has effectively accepted Taliban conditions that there will be no formal talks on the education ban.…The United Nations has announced that the third Doha meeting, which will include special representatives for Afghanistan from various countries, will take place on June 30 and will last for two days.…The third UN-led Doha meeting on Afghanistan is scheduled for June 30, and diplomatic efforts are in full swing to seek the Taliban’s presence at the event. Qatar, the host, too, is keen to make the two-day huddle meaningful with the participation of Kabul representatives, unlike the previous two meeting…Faiz Mohammad Zaland, a representative of Afghan civil society present at the second Doha meeting, noted that the Taliban’s participation is conditional, with ongoing negotiations regarding the level of their representation.…The Doha meeting, scheduled for June 30 and July 1 at the United Nations initiative in Qatar’s capital, has influenced many regional meetings. The agendas of many of these meetings, including the Ankara meeting and a series of meetings by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Taliban, have been dedicated to consultations on this matter…This call was then repeated at the June 30-July 1 United Nations Doha meeting of special national envoys to Afghanistan.
